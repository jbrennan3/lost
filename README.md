CIS 322 Full Stack Software Engineering Project

This is a project simulating a career in full stack development.

To begin initial setup run install_daemons:  
  This will install Apache httpd and Postgres
  
After installation has completed you must create a target database in psql.
  Once a target database has been made you can run the preflight script, which takes an argument of the database target name.
